# The Sorted Pulse Library (SPDLib) #

SPDLib is a set of open source software tools for processing laser scanning data (i.e., LiDAR), including data captured from airborne and terrestrial platforms. A key feature of SPDLib is the ability to process and store full waveform datasets alongside traditional discrete return data.

## Installing ##

Binaries of SPDLib for Mac OS X and Linux are provided through [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). After installing minconda, SPDLib and the required pre-requisites can be installed using:

```
conda install -c osgeo -c conda-forge -c rios spdlib
```

## Documentation ##

The documentation for SPDLib is available from: https://bitbucket.org/petebunting/spdlib-documentation

Tutorials are available from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/spdlib/files/Tutorials/
